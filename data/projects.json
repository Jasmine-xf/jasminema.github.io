      "Generic travel recommendations don't match individual preferences, interests, or budget constraints",
      "Users waste time filtering through irrelevant suggestions and miss out on hidden gems",
      "Post-trip, users struggle to recall details and context from their travel experiences",
      "Lack of community connection with travelers who share similar interests and travel styles"
    ],
    "process": "Conducted user interviews with 15+ travelers to understand pain points in current recommendation systems. Created detailed personas based on travel styles, interests, and demographics. Developed user journey maps to identify key touchpoints and opportunities for improvement.",
    "research": "Key findings revealed that 78% of travelers struggle with generic recommendations that don't match their preferences. Users expressed frustration with time spent filtering irrelevant suggestions and missing out on hidden gems. The research identified three distinct traveler personas: Budget Backpackers, Luxury Seekers, and Cultural Explorers.",
    "implementation": "Built a mobile-first platform using React Native with a Node.js backend. Implemented a machine learning recommendation engine using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. Created a tagging system for travel experiences and developed similarity matching algorithms based on user preferences and behavior patterns.",
    "results": "Prototype testing with 20 users showed 85% improvement in recommendation relevance compared to existing platforms. Users reported 60% reduction in time spent searching for relevant travel suggestions. The community-driven approach resulted in 90% user retention rate during the 2-month testing period."
