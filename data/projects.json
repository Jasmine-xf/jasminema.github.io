    "research": "Key findings revealed that 78% of travelers struggle with generic recommendations that don't match their preferences. Users expressed frustration with time spent filtering irrelevant suggestions and missing out on hidden gems. The research identified three distinct traveler personas: Budget Backpackers, Luxury Seekers, and Cultural Explorers.",
    "implementation": "Built a mobile-first platform using React Native with a Node.js backend. Implemented a machine learning recommendation engine using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. Created a tagging system for travel experiences and developed similarity matching algorithms based on user preferences and behavior patterns.",

Users reported 60% reduction in time spent searching for relevant travel suggestions. The community-driven approach resulted in 90% user retention rate during the 2-month testing period."
