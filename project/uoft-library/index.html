                <p class="work-subtitle ">
                    Navigating the University of Toronto’s St. George campus is often challenging due to complex building layouts, inconsistent signage, and limited accessibility support. Existing tools such as Google Maps or static floor plans cannot provide accurate, room-level guidance, leaving many students, visitors, and individuals with accessibility needs struggling to find their way efficiently.
                   
                </p>
                <p class="work-subtitle ">
                    This project investigates the barriers to campus wayfinding and defines the high-priority requirements for an indoor navigation system tailored to UofT. Based on surveys, interviews, and thematic analysis, we identified six core needs — real-time positioning, accessible routes, room-level search, clear landmarks, multilingual support, and an intuitive campus map — leading to a proposed solution that reduces navigation time, improves accessibility, and enhances the overall campus experience.

                                            <strong>Information about indoor spaces is fragmented and static.</strong> Most tools rely on outdated floor maps or scattered signage, which causes confusion and inconsistency across buildings.
                                            <br>→ There's a need for a centralized, real-time navigation system that updates continuously.

                                            <strong>User confidence and independence are limited.</strong> Research shows that many people—especially newcomers and those with accessibility needs—depend on asking others for directions.

Using “How Might We” questions, our team generated and sketched multiple ideas, such as a 360° view, predictive search, positioning, and accessibility filters.

                            <h3>Why</h3>
                            <p>After completing our low-fidelity web and mobile wireframes, we conducted a lean evaluation to validate early navigation flows and identify usability gaps before building high-fidelity prototypes. This step helped us ensure that our design addressed key user goals such as clarity, accessibility, and independence during wayfinding.</p>
                            
                            <h3 class="pt-4">How</h3>
                            <p>We ran 4 quick usability sessions with UofT students in MADLab's early testing environment.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Materials:</strong> printed and digital wireframes for both desktop and mobile versions.</li>
                                <li><strong>Setting:</strong> conducted on campus (Gerstein Library, Bahen Centre) through convenience sampling.</li>
                                <li><strong>Method:</strong> participants completed basic navigation tasks (searching rooms, switching floors, closing pop-ups, and using filters) while thinking aloud.</li>
                                <li><strong>Observation Focus:</strong> interaction clarity, layout consistency, and accessibility readiness (contrast, font size, icons).</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h3 class="pt-4">Key Insights</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Users instinctively tried to close pop-ups by tapping outside the box, not just the "X" button.</li>
                                <li>The bottom navigation displayed too many steps; users preferred seeing only 2–3 at once.</li>
                                <li>The minimap lacked readability—participants asked for stronger color contrast and clearer landmarks.</li>
                                <li>Accessibility elements such as text size and contrast needed improvement for real-world usability.</li>
                                <li>Filters were well-received but required clearer icons for washrooms, exits, and study zones.</li>
                            </ul>
