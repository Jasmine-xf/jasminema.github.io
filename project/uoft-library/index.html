                <p class="work-subtitle ">
                    Navigating the University of Toronto’s St. George campus is often challenging due to complex building layouts, inconsistent signage, and limited accessibility support. Existing tools such as Google Maps or static floor plans cannot provide accurate, room-level guidance, leaving many students, visitors, and individuals with accessibility needs struggling to find their way efficiently.
                   
                </p>
                <p class="work-subtitle ">
                    This project investigates the barriers to campus wayfinding and defines the high-priority requirements for an indoor navigation system tailored to UofT. Based on surveys, interviews, and thematic analysis, we identified six core needs — real-time positioning, accessible routes, room-level search, clear landmarks, multilingual support, and an intuitive campus map — leading to a proposed solution that reduces navigation time, improves accessibility, and enhances the overall campus experience.

                                            <strong>Information about indoor spaces is fragmented and static.</strong> Most tools rely on outdated floor maps or scattered signage, which causes confusion and inconsistency across buildings.
                                            <br>→ There's a need for a centralized, real-time navigation system that updates continuously.

                                            <strong>User confidence and independence are limited.</strong> Research shows that many people—especially newcomers and those with accessibility needs—depend on asking others for directions.

Using “How Might We” questions, our team generated and sketched multiple ideas, such as a 360° view, predictive search, positioning, and accessibility filters.

                                <li><strong>Preview & Decide:</strong> A minimap with floor selector shows the shortest path; 360° indoor view provides spatial context.
