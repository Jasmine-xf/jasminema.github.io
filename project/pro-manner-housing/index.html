                    Renting in Canada is often shaped by legal uncertainty, fragmented communication, and limited documentation. In a short, exploratory hackathon setting, we examined why many landlords hesitate to rent out their properties and why tenants, especially newcomers, often feel unsure about lease terms and responsibilities. These issues leave both parties entering rental agreements with low confidence and limited trust.
                </p>
                <p class="work-subtitle ">
                    This project explores the lease-making process through a design lens, focusing on how clearer structure, legal guidance, and traceable communication could reduce risk early on. Based on rapid research and prototyping, we proposed an end-to-end lease-making experience that supports informed decision-making and helps landlords and tenants engage with greater clarity from the start.

                                    <p>To improve confidence and clarity at the start of the rental relationship, I focused on redesigning the lease-making process itself rather than adding isolated features.</p>
                                    <p>I worked on structuring the process so that legal and financial risks become visible before a lease is signed, helping landlords and tenants understand expectations early on. I also designed mechanisms that support clearer communication and preserve key records—such as lease terms, document submissions, and maintenance-related exchanges—so they can be referenced later if issues arise.</p>
                                    <p>By reframing the lease-making experience as a guided, traceable process, the project explores how better structure and transparency can reduce conflict and make renting feel more predictable for both parties.</p>

                                    <p>We reviewed existing rental platforms, lease templates, and policy documentation in the Ontario rental market, and conducted interviews with property managers and real estate agents who regularly handle lease agreements and disputes.</p>
                                    <p>Across both secondary and primary research, several consistent gaps emerged:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Most solutions focus on listing or basic property management, with limited support for lease quality and post-signing risk</li>
                                        <li>Agent and property management services are costly, often charging at least one month of rent</li>
                                        <li>Transparency is limited, especially around lease terms, responsibilities, and decision-making</li>
                                        <li>Real-time regulation updates and impartial guidance are rarely available</li>
                                        <li>Communication is fragmented and difficult to track over time</li>
                                        <li>Credit reports and supporting documents are hard to verify reliably</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Comparative analysis showed that no existing option provides an affordable, transparent, and end-to-end experience that supports lease clarity, regulation awareness, communication records, and document verification at once.

                                        <li><strong>Credit reports and supporting documents are difficult to verify</strong></li>
                                        <li><strong>Custom lease clauses are often written without knowing whether they comply with local laws</strong></li>

                                    <p>Rental conflicts are rarely caused by bad intent. They usually result from unclear expectations, missing documentation, and late access to legal guidance, which are difficult to fix once a lease is signed.</p>
                                    <p>This shifted the design focus from enforcement to prevention, guided by three principles:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Reduce uncertainty at key decision moments</strong></li>
                                        <li><strong>Support informed human judgment</strong></li>

                                    <p>During ideation, we explored multiple ways to support clarity and trust in the rental process, including automated lease creation, centralized communication tools, and evidence-tracking mechanisms.</p>
                                    <p>Rather than treating these as isolated features, we evaluated how each idea fit into the overall lease lifecycle and whether it reduced risk for both parties.</p>

                                    <p>The system applies AI to review custom lease clauses and assist with credit report verification, helping surface potential risks and inconsistencies early in the lease-making process.</p>
                                    <p><strong>User data and security were treated as foundational.</strong></p>
                                    <p>The backend uses role-based access control, secure authentication, and protected APIs to ensure users only access information relevant to their role. Sensitive records such as lease documents, conversations, and credit reports are stored in structured modules to support traceability while minimizing unnecessary data exposure.</p>
