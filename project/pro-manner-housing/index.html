Pro Manner Housing addresses this gap by creating a comprehensive platform that supports the entire rental lifecycle.</p>

                <div class="detail-section mb-5">
                    <h4 class="mb-3">User Research</h4>
                    <p>Key findings revealed that 85% of tenants use multiple platforms to find and manage their rental experience, leading to fragmented workflows. 72% reported frustration with lack of transparency in property information, and 68% struggled with poor communication with landlords. The research identified four distinct user personas: First-time Renters, Experienced Tenants, Lease Managers, and Property Investors, each with different needs and usage patterns.</p>

Created a unified design system with consistent components and interaction patterns. Implemented advanced search and filtering capabilities with real-time property data integration. Built integrated communication tools, document management system, and payment tracking features.

The integrated platform approach resulted in 85% user retention rate and 40% reduction in support tickets. Property managers noted improved tenant satisfaction and streamlined operations through the unified platform.</p>
