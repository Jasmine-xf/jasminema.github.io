                    Renting in Canada is often shaped by legal uncertainty, fragmented communication, and limited documentation. In a short, exploratory hackathon setting, we examined why many landlords hesitate to rent out their properties and why tenants, especially newcomers, often feel unsure about lease terms and responsibilities. These issues leave both parties entering rental agreements with low confidence and limited trust.
                </p>
                <p class="work-subtitle ">
                    This project explores the lease-making process through a design lens, focusing on how clearer structure, legal guidance, and traceable communication could reduce risk early on. Based on rapid research and prototyping, we proposed an end-to-end lease-making experience that supports informed decision-making and helps landlords and tenants engage with greater clarity from the start.

                                    <p>In cities like Toronto, rental discussions often focus on rising prices and limited housing supply. During early exploration, we noticed a less visible but equally important issue behind this shortage.</p>
                                    <p>Many landlords are reluctant to rent out their properties, not because of low demand, but because the rental process feels risky and unpredictable. Lease responsibilities are unclear, disputes are costly, and evidence is difficult to prepare once problems arise. At the same time, many tenants, especially newcomers to Canada, struggle to understand rental laws and contract terms, which leaves them feeling insecure during the leasing process.</p>
                                    <p>As a result, both parties often enter a lease defensively, with limited trust and transparency from the very beginning.</p>
