                <p class="work-subtitle ">
                    The Public-Sector Web Registry System is an internal tool used across a large government organization to manage website records, domains, and governance data. The system supports hundreds of program teams who rely on accurate website information for audits, renewals, compliance, and day-to-day content management. <br>
                </p>
                <p class="work-subtitle ">
                    Usability issues had been slowing down work—users struggled to find information, export data, or add new records efficiently. To modernize the system and reduce onboarding friction, we conducted evaluative research, mapped key workflows, and redesigned the core interactions to support clarity, scalability, and accessibility.

                                    <p>Users were taking far too long to locate simple information such as website owners, URLs, statuses, or expiry dates.

                        <p>The Citizen Service Portal project taught me that designing for government services requires a deep understanding of accessibility, inclusivity, and the diverse needs of citizens. Working with complex organizational structures showed how important it is to prioritize user needs over internal processes. I also learned how critical it is to design with accessibility from the start rather than retrofitting it later. Most importantly, this project reinforced the value of inclusive design and the responsibility we have as designers to ensure digital services are accessible to everyone in our communities.</p>
