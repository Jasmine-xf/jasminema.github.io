                                    <p class="value-content">Unlike fragmented government websites with inconsistent patterns, the redesigned portal creates a unified navigation system that works across all departments and services, reducing confusion and improving user confidence.</p>

                        <p>The Citizen Service Portal project taught me that designing for government services requires a deep understanding of accessibility, inclusivity, and the diverse needs of citizens. Working with complex organizational structures showed how important it is to prioritize user needs over internal processes. I also learned how critical it is to design with accessibility from the start rather than retrofitting it later. Most importantly, this project reinforced the value of inclusive design and the responsibility we have as designers to ensure digital services are accessible to everyone in our communities.</p>
