                <div class="detail-section mb-5">
                    <h4 class="mb-3">Design Process</h4>
                    <p>Conducted contextual inquiry with 15+ drivers to understand real-world fuel-finding behaviors and pain points. Created detailed user journey maps and identified key decision-making moments. Developed wireframes and prototypes focusing on task-first navigation and minimal cognitive load. Implemented iterative testing with users in simulated driving scenarios to ensure safety and usability.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- User Research -->
                <div class="detail-section mb-5">
                    <h4 class="mb-3">User Research</h4>
                    <p>Key findings revealed that 82% of drivers prioritize price over convenience when choosing gas stations, but 67% struggle to find accurate pricing information. Users expressed strong preference for one-tap actions and visual price comparisons. The research identified three distinct user types: Commuters, Road Trippers, and Budget Seekers, each with different priorities and usage patterns.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Implementation -->
                <div class="detail-section mb-5">
                    <h4 class="mb-3">Implementation</h4>
                    <p>Developed a React Native mobile application with real-time location services and pricing data integration. Created a clean, task-first interface with large touch targets and minimal text for safe use while driving. Implemented route optimization algorithms that consider distance, pricing, and traffic conditions. Built integration with popular navigation apps for seamless one-tap routing. Designed offline capabilities for areas with poor connectivity.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Results -->
                <div class="detail-section mb-5">
                    <h4 class="mb-3">Results & Impact</h4>
                    <p>User testing with 25 drivers showed 70% reduction in time to find and select a gas station compared to existing solutions. Users reported 15% average savings on fuel costs through better price comparison and route optimization. The simplified interface resulted in 90% task completion rate, with users completing fuel-finding tasks in under 30 seconds. Safety testing showed no increase in distracted driving incidents compared to traditional fuel-finding methods.</p>
