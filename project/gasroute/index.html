                    Helping drivers stop overthinking gas stops
                </p>
                <p class="work-subtitle ">
                    In Toronto, getting gas is rarely a quick decision. Drivers constantly weigh price differences against detours, traffic, time pressure, and safety. Late at night, that decision gets even heavier.
                </p>
                <p class="work-subtitle ">
                    Most tools make this harder than it needs to be. They show prices and locations, but ignore real context like where someone is headed or whether saving a few cents is actually worth the extra drive. People end up checking multiple options, hesitating, or taking detours they regret later.
                </p>
                <p class="work-subtitle ">
                    Gas Route starts from a simple idea. Refueling is a routine task, and it should not feel like a small math problem every time.

                                <p>After talking to users and reviewing survey responses, a few patterns showed up again and again.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>People cared about price, but only when the savings felt meaningful.</li>
                                    <li>At night, safety often became the deciding factor.</li>
                                    <li>Many drivers trusted familiar stations or places tied to reward programs.</li>
                                    <li>Most importantly, people did not feel confused by a lack of data. They felt unsure about how to choose.</li>

                                    <p>Several issues surfaced:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Transitions between search results and station details were not always clear</li>
                                        <li>Price, distance, and safety information competed for attention</li>
                                        <li>Some actions felt repetitive across screens</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>The feedback confirmed the concept, but showed where the flow needed to be more focused.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="value-title mt-5">Refinement into Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
                                    <p>Based on testing feedback, we refined the flows into mid-fidelity wireframes. The focus shifted to clarity and consistency rather than visual polish.</p>
                                    <p>In the mid-fi version, we simplified task steps, clarified decision points, and reorganized information hierarchy. Actions such as selecting a station, checking safety, and starting navigation became more direct and consistent.</p>
                                    <p>These changes reduced friction and better reflected how users make real-world refueling decisions.</p>
