                    Helping drivers stop overthinking gas stops
                </p>
                <p class="work-subtitle ">
                    In Toronto, getting gas is rarely a quick decision. Drivers constantly weigh price differences against detours, traffic, time pressure, and safety. Late at night, that decision gets even heavier.
                </p>
                <p class="work-subtitle ">
                    Most tools make this harder than it needs to be. They show prices and locations, but ignore real context like where someone is headed or whether saving a few cents is actually worth the extra drive. People end up checking multiple options, hesitating, or taking detours they regret later.
                </p>
                <p class="work-subtitle ">
                    Gas Route starts from a simple idea. Refueling is a routine task, and it should not feel like a small math problem every time.

                                <p>After talking to users and reviewing survey responses, a few patterns showed up again and again.</p>

                                    <li>People cared about price, but only when the savings felt meaningful.</li>
                                    <li>At night, safety often became the deciding factor.</li>
                                    <li>Many drivers trusted familiar stations or places tied to reward programs.</li>
                                    <li>Most importantly, people did not feel confused by a lack of data. They felt unsure about how to choose.</li>
